      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>Hi, My Name is Mohammed and I love business. <br>
      I was born in Iraq, went on a youth exchange program called <em>IYLEP</em> in 2015 and it opened my perspective horizon
      Since then, I started to code and to help my community with some projects.
      Back Then, I had started my own blog about Technology, i named it <em>Muhammed Tech</em>. however due to 
      polticial problems in Iraq my family and i moved to germany, where i finished my school in 2020 and started studying
      information systems or as we call it in germany <em>Wirtschaftsinformatik</em>. That's when i got my passion back
      and decided to push it further. Currently i am learning the Full Stack Engineer Path on CodeCademy to discover more options.
      I want to become an IT-Consulatant and have a specialiazation in <strong>Automation & Optimization</strong>.
      I hope you enjoy clicking around and if anything feel free to contact me on my socials on the right side.
